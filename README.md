Technical Report
Most Technical challenge
Our team faced a problem concerning branches organization, where some team members accidentally modified an already existing code directly in the develop branch instead of their own branch.
Merge conflict
The merge conflict we faced was because of the technical issue described above, and we handled it manually by pulling the modified code and added the features that were removed.
Efficacy Evaluation
The pull request to the main branch was successful, as all merge conflicts were handled in the develop branch.
